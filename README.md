An R package for reconstructing and visualizing transit vehicle
trajectories.

## Introduction

Today’s transit vehicles generate a large amount of automatic vehicle
location (AVL) data. This data is vital in planning and performance
studies, but turning sparse and noisy GPS pings into meaningful
performance metrics is difficult. `transittraj` fills this gap,
integrating with existing open data standards, including GTFS and TIDES,
to provide tools for cleaning AVL data and fitting continuous,
monotonic, invertible, and differentiable trajectory curves. By doing
so, `transittraj` provides versatile and powerful tools to analyze
transit system performance and support decision-making.

## Installation

You can install `transittraj` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("transittraj")
```

## Statement of Need

The primary goal of `transittraj` is to reconstruct *trajectories* of
transit vehicles from AVL data. A trajectory is a function which
describes the one-dimensional position (i.e., the distance from a trip’s
beginning) of a transit vehicle over time. Vehicle trajectories are
incredibly powerful and versatile tools, and are widely used by traffic
engineers and operations researchers for planning and system performance
studies.

Transit professionals, however, rarely have the opportunity to see
detailed trajectories of their vehicles, and instead typically only
receive finalized metrics – such as dwell times and segment-level travel
times – from analytics platforms. If a practitioner wanted to apply
trajectory fitting tools from parallel fields, they would likely
encounter challenges: transit data adheres to unique formatting
standards; very few open-source tools exist for handling transit vehicle
location data; and, most importantly, common GPS processing techniques
can oversmooth transit trajectories because AVL pings occur with the
same frequency (15-30 seconds) as stop dwells, signal delays, and other
stop-and-go cycles.

`transittraj` fills this gap by proposing a workflow with two main
steps. The first is data cleaning, where we focus on correcting noise
and errors in point observations. Second, we use cleaned position and
speed measurements to fit an interpolating curve representing the
vehicle’s trajectory. This curve has four important attributes:

- *Continuous*: There should be no gaps in the trajectory for each trip.

- *Monotonic*: The vehicle’s position should strictly increase.

- *Invertible*: The trajectory should provide position as a function of
  time, or time as a function of position.

- *Differentiable*: At any point on the curve, we should be able to
  interpolate for the speed of the vehicle.

`transittraj` aims to make these workflows as smooth and accessible as
possible. We begin with data that adheres to industry standard data
formats, including [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) and
[TIDES](https://tides-transit.org/main/), and functions are flexible but
avoid techniques which require complex tuning. Finally, we provide tools
to visualize and apply fit trajectory curves.
